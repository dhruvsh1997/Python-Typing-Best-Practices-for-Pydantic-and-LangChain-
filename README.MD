# Python Typing for Pydantic, LangChain, and LangGraph

## Overview

This Google Colab notebook introduces Python's `typing` library, focusing on key concepts used in [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/), and [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/). It is designed for beginners who are new to type hints and want to understand their practical applications in data validation (Pydantic) and building LLM-powered applications (LangChain and LangGraph).

The notebook covers:
- Basic type hints for variables and functions
- Generic types (`List`, `Dict`)
- `Union` and `Optional` for flexible typing
- Type aliases for simplifying complex types
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Typing in LangChain and LangGraph for defining tools
- Best practices for using type hints effectively

Each section includes a brief explanation, sample code, and comments to clarify the concepts, making it easy to follow and execute in Google Colab.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python (variables, functions, and classes)
- A Google account to access Google Colab
- Familiarity with installing Python packages (optional for local setup)

## Setup Instructions

### Running in Google Colab
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the notebook file (`Python_Typing_Notebook.ipynb`) or copy its contents into a new Colab notebook.
3. Ensure an internet connection to install dependencies.
4. Run the first cell to install required packages (if not already available):
   ```bash
   !pip install pydantic
   ```
5. Execute each cell sequentially to explore the examples and see the output.

### Running Locally
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pydantic
   ```
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Python_Typing_Notebook.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells to explore the examples.

## Usage

1. **Open the Notebook**: Load the notebook in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
2. **Read the Explanations**: Each section starts with a brief markdown explanation of a typing concept, followed by sample code.
3. **Run the Code**: Execute each code cell to see the output and understand how type hints work.
4. **Experiment**: Modify the sample code (e.g., change types or inputs) to deepen your understanding.
5. **Review Best Practices**: Refer to the best practices section for tips on writing clean, type-safe code.
